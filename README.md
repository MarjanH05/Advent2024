# Advent2024
All my attempts at the Advent 2024 written in c++ , not the cleanest code..  

This is only designed to complete the task with the specific input data and is not checking for any errors , different variables or desgined super efficienlty in general!
Do use part 2 of a 'day' after opening the solution - click on properties , switch start-up project to Day x -Advent Code.2.
